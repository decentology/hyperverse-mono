# Project Idea

## Airdrop
The Airdrop Dapp will be able to distribute airdrop token to connected wallet only once until the Airdrop period is over.

## Pre-sale Dapp



### Prerequisities

To be able to interact with the dapp, you need a Metmask Wallet and Rinkeby eth.

1. **Metamask**

    If you do not have a metamask wallet, [here](https://www.surgewomen.io/learn-about-web3/set-up-metamask-wallet) is a guide you can follow on how to set up one.

2. **Rinkeby Faucets**

    To get some Rinkeby eth here are some available faucets you can request from:

-   https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/

    Or ask us to send you some in our [Discord Server.](http://discord.gg/decentology)
